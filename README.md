## Overview
This repository contains the backing source code for my [Golang](https://golang.org) lessons. Each of these lessons are published on [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

These lessons cover a variety of topics for Golang and are designed to help a developer that is learning how to do specific things in Go.

Most of my lessons have a [Team Fight Tactics](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/teamfight-tactics) (aka TFT) theme, which is a video game I love to play and is published by the company I work for, Riot Games. My lessons may use champions, items and/or concepts from the game.

Each folder in this repository represents a separate lesson. You can navigate to each lesson folder to see additional details about the source code in that lesson.

My intent is that you find these lessons helpful and in case you also love to play TFT, I'm *Zorkanian*. Send me a friend request and let me know you found me via my lessons.

In case you wonder, Zorkanian comes from my love of one of the earliest games I ever played as a teenager, [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).
