# Declaring and creating a slice/array
There are numerous ways that you can declare and create a slice/array in Go. This lesson will show you several and I talk about the advantages and disadvantages of one over another. After watching, you will better understand all of the possible ways you can declare/create as well as the idiomatic way.

These include:
* var
* new
* make
* literals

While it is not the main intent of this lesson, I do touch on some of the differences between a slice and an array.
